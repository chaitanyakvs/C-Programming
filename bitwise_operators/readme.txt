Bitwise operators
-----------------

--> Manipulating individual bits of a byte is possible through bitwise operators, this feature was not available in most of the high-level programming languages.

	The bitwise operators are :-

				& - Bitwise AND
				| - Bitwise OR
				^ - Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR)
				~ - Bitwise NOT (1's Compliment)
				<< - Bitwise left shift
				>> - Bitwise right shift
